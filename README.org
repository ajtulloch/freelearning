* =FreeLearning.hs=
This is an experiment in writing a clean DSL for deep neural networks
in Haskell. There are two approaches

- =Free.hs=, where a free monad is built and interpreted and
  visualized.
  
  For example,
  
  #+begin_src haskell
    alexNet :: NN ()
    -- alexNetColumns = Free (Split $ replicate 2 $ Free (Node ReLU (Free End)))
    alexNet = Free (Split $ replicate 2 (features >> classifier))

    classifier :: NN ()
    classifier = mapM_ layer [
                   DropOut, FullyConnected [[1]], ReLU,
                   DropOut, FullyConnected [[1]], ReLU,
                   FullyConnected [[1]], LogSoftMax]

    features :: NN ()
    features = mapM_ layer [
                   Convolution, ReLU, MaxPool,
                   Convolution, ReLU, MaxPool,
                   Convolution, ReLU,
                   Convolution, ReLU,
                   Convolution, ReLU, MaxPool]

    slp :: [[Float]] -> NN ()
    slp weights = do
        layer (FullyConnected weights)
        layer ReLU

    mlp :: [[[Float]]] -> NN ()
    mlp = mapM_ slp
  #+end_src


- =Graph.hs=, where the network structure is built by constructing a
  DFG in the State monad.
  
  For example,
  
  #+begin_src haskell
    alexNet :: G
    alexNet = toGraph $ do
      inputId <- layer Input
      (splitId, joinId) <- fork (replicate 2 alexNetColumn)
      connect inputId splitId

      (classifierId, _) <- column classifierColumn
      connect joinId classifierId
      return ()
        where
          alexNetColumn = [
               Convolution, ReLU, MaxPool,
               Convolution, ReLU, MaxPool,
               Convolution, ReLU,
               Convolution, ReLU,
               Convolution, ReLU, MaxPool]

          classifierColumn = [
               DropOut, FullyConnected [[1]], ReLU,
               DropOut, FullyConnected [[1]], ReLU,
               FullyConnected [[1]], LogSoftMax
              ]
  #+end_src
